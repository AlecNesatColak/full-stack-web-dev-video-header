## Before the Bootcamp

Hi, everyone. Here's some preparation for you to do before we meet:

- Have a web browser of your choice and know how to open it. Examples: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Vivaldi, etc.

  Ensure you can open the browser Developer Tools (DevTools), usually pressing F12 on the keyboard; OR right-click anywhere, then choose Inspect.

  If you use Safari, you might have to enable it by going to Settings, Advanced, check the `Show features for web developers` option (aka Show Develop menu in menu bar). Reference: https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-the-developer-tools-in-the-develop-menu-sfri20948/mac

- Have installed a text editor / integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. I recommend Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

- Install Git program for code version control: https://git-scm.com/downloads

- Register an account on GitHub, the social coding collaboration platform: https://github.com

- Know how to open a Terminal program so we can run commands. Examples: Command Prompt (CMD.exe), PowerShell, Terminal, iTerm 2, Git Bash, etc.

- Have installed Node.js, which is serverside JavaScript, and NPM, the Node Package Manager: https://nodejs.org/
(NPM usually comes bundled with Node)

- Have installed PostgreSQL database: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

- Have a smartphone and install the Expo app, for mobile development:
Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=ww
iOS https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779

- If you're on macOS, I recommend installing Homebrew package manager (https://brew.sh/) in case you need to install watchman for the React Native lecture.
